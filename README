Katari is a nanokernel-based OS for ARM.

What works:
 * Booting on AM335x(assisted by TI StarterWare bootloader)
 * Printing to serial on AM335x (currently in kernel for debugging purposes,
 	will be removed soon)
 * Context switching (needs significant work)

What doesn't:
 * Executable loading
 * Floating point (VFP/NEON)
 * Systems other than AM335x
 * IPC, and syscalls in general
 * Virtual memory
